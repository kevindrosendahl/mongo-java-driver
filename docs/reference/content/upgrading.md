## Upgrading from 3.9.x

In the upcoming 4.0 release, all deprecated API elements except those documented as "not currently scheduled for removal" will be removed. 
Currently the only API elements _not_ scheduled for removal are:

* [`Mongo.getDB`]({{<apiref "com/mongodb/Mongo.html#getDB-java.lang.String-">}})
* [`JsonMode.STRICT`]({{<apiref "org/bson/json/JsonMode.html#STRICT">}}) 

To prepare for the 4.0 release, please compile with deprecation warnings enabled and replace all usage of deprecated API elements with their
recommended replacements.

Also, note that the 3.11 release (which will include support for MongoDB 4.2) will be the last release that is compatible with *Java 6
or Java 7*.  The 4.0 Java driver will require a minimum of Java 8. The 3.11 release will also be the last non-patch release in the 3.x 
line. In particular, support for MongoDB 4.4 will only be made available via a 4.x driver release.

The 3.10 release is binary and source compatible with the 3.9 release, except for methods that have been added to interfaces that
have been marked as unstable, and changes to classes or interfaces that have been marked as internal or annotated as Beta.

## Upgrading from 2.x

See the Upgrade guide in the 3.0 driver reference documentation for breaking changes in 3.0.

## System Requirements

The minimum JVM is Java 8.
